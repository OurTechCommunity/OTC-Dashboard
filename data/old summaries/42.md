Hey @**everyone**, we had a fun 7 hr 18 min session!
Thank you all for joining in! :smiley:

## Topics discussed

- General introductions.
- @**Harsh Kapadia** told everyone about [CSS `clamp()`](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp()>) for responsive font sizes.
- [Krishna Gadia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-gadia) explained what the Linux command `rm -rf /` does.
  - `rm` stands for 'remove'. It deletes files or directories
  - `-r` is a flag (option) that stands for 'recursive' and targets directories and files within directories till the bottommost level.
  - `-f` is a flag (option) that stands for 'force' and forces the command to delete all protected files. Basically allows a force delete.
  - `/` is the path to delete files from and '/' indicates the root folder and thus this command deletes every file present on a machine, including the OS. Only files loaded in the RAM make things work till the machine is not powered off. It won't restart.
  - It would be advisable to do this only in a new Docker container.
- GitHub CodeSpaces, GitPod and KataCoda are based on Docker containers.
- @**Jay Kaku**, [Krishna Gadia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-gadia) and Santhoshi talked about a Garden Watering hardware idea for automatic sprinkler switching on and off. It was a long drawn out exciting discussion with things like solenoids, DC motors, servo motors, step motors, H bridges, Arduino Driver Shields, Power Shields and other hardware components being discussed.
- @**Kartik Soneji** and [Krishna Gadia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-gadia) told us about NoSQL and SQL vs columnar and row-based databases.
  - NoSQL and SQL is not related to columnar and row-based DBs. Columnar and row-based DBs are named on the basis of how data is stored. Columnar DBs have columns stored together on the disc while row-based DBs are stored row-wise on disc.
  - Columnar databases are mostly used for analytical querying in OLAP scenarios and row-based databases which are more efficient for querying are used in OLTP scenarios because of varying use cases.
  - Query syntax is the same.
  - MariaDB can handle both columnar and row-based data storage depending on the flags passed.
- We talked about why denormalized data is good for analytical purposes.
