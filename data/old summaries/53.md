## Topics Discussed

- General introductions.
- We talked about how Microsoft is competing with [Notion](notion.so) with it's latest offering called [Microsoft Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop), which has a similar look to Notion.
- @**ishandeveloper** told us about his favourite [React India](https://www.reactindia.io) talks. (Watch the conference: [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhfR8xDQrO0) and [Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JuLIGeXsxI))
